# Introduction

This is going to be simple pomodoro App, built with the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework.\
Even though there are a lot of pomodoro apps out there, none of them seem to fit my UX needs. \
Also, I have been using "dynamic pomodoros" for some time and it looks like there are no easy to find tools that support it. A call it dynamic pomodoros because it does not use pomodoros with fixed size. You can work on your tasks until you decide to make a break. The break times (short or long) are then calculated proportionally to the time you spent working. This is useful if you are in the middle of a task and you are very concentrated and you don't want to stop doing it just because your preconfigured pomodoro time is up. (Disclaimer: This techique has no scientific basis that I know).\
Also, I wanted to practicize some Svelte ðŸ˜† 

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-pomodoro
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:5000.

## Next dev steps
